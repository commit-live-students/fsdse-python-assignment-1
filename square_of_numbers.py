# Python Programming Basics - Assignment

### Problem Statement:

# With a given integral number n, write a function to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i)
# such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included).
# 1. Define function 'squareOfNumbers' which will accept number argument.
# 2. Number should not be less than 0 and should not be grater than 100.
# 3. Calculate square of all number from 1 to n and store in dict.
# 4. Function should pass all test cases.

def squareOfNumbers(n):
    dict = {}
    i = 0;
    while i <= n:
        dict[i] = i ** 2
        i=i+1
    return dict

print squareOfNumbers(8)
